Thesis Query

You can test hugging face LLM as well here by changing the commented out line from line 31 to 30 in  thesis_query.py

You'll need to make a free account on pinecone's website and copy and paste your API key into the thesis_query.py file on line 46. Or you can alternatively figure out how to use Langchain's built in vector store chroma instead.
